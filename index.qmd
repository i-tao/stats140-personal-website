I am a senior at UCLA double majoring in Statistics & Data Science and Economics. My academic journey has led her towards an interest in financial services, consulting, marketing, and analytics.

I offer quantitative skills in data science and analytics complemented by business and financial knowledge. Beyond academics, I've been a leader in many student organizations that have helped me develop core qualitative skills, including collaboration, adaptability, and communication. I’m very results-driven, and I focus on excellence on whatever I put my heart and mind into.

Outside of academic and career pursuits, I enjoy swimming, playing tennis/pickleball, watching Formula 1 racing, and exploring local cafes to find the perfect matcha latte!
