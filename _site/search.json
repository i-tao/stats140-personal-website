My academic journey has led her towards an interest in financial services, consulting, marketing, and analytics.\nI offer quantitative skills in data science and analytics complemented by business and financial knowledge. Beyond academics, I’ve been a leader in many student organizations that have helped me develop core qualitative skills, including collaboration, adaptability, and communication. I’m very results-driven, and I focus on excellence on whatever I put my heart and mind into.\nOutside of academic and career pursuits, I enjoy swimming, playing tennis/pickleball, watching Formula 1 racing, and exploring local cafes to find the perfect matcha latte!\nFeel free to take a look at my resume !"
